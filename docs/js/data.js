Vulnerability scanning Some active reconnaissance tests will query systems directly to see if a vulnerability currently exists.\n\nC. Supply chain analysis A supply chain analysis will examine the security associated with a supplier, and the analysis will not provide any information regarding a company's own servers and data.\n\nD. Regulatory audit A regulatory audit is a detailed security analysis based on existing laws or private guidelines. A regulatory audit commonly requires access to internal systems and data.",

Enable time-of-day restrictions on the authentication server Adding location-based policies will prevent direct data access from outside of the country. Saving log information from all devices and creating audit reports from a single database can be implemented through the use of a SIEM (Security Information and Event Manager). Adding a check for the time-of-day will report any access that occurs during non-working hours. 51 \n\nThe incorrect answers:\n\nB.

Confirm that no unauthorized accounts have administrator access It’s always a good idea to periodically audit administrator accounts, but this audit won’t provide any validation that all former employee accounts have been disabled.\n\nB. Validate the account lockout policy Account lockouts occur when a number of invalid authentication attempts have been made to a valid account. Disabled accounts would not be locked out because they are not currently valid accounts.\n\nD.

This will prevent the malicious files from executing and will safely store the files for any future investigation. The second file in the list failed the quarantine process, and was most likely because the library was already in use by the operating system and could not be moved. \n\nThe incorrect answers:\n\nB. The host-based firewall blocked two traffic flows A host-based firewall will allow or deny traffic flows based on IP address, port number, application, or other criteria. A host-based firewall does not block traffic flows based on the name of an existing file, and the firewall process would not quarantine or move files to other folders. 194\n\nC. A host-based allow list has blocked two applications from executing The “quarantine” disposition refers to a file that has been moved from one location to another. An allow list function would simply stop the application from executing without changing the location of an application file.\n\nD. A network-based IPS has identified two known vulnerabilities The logs from a network-based IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) would not commonly be located on a user’s laptop, and those logs would display allow or deny dispositions based on the name of a known vulnerability.

Data center access with only one authentication factor Most hacktivists don’t have access to walk around inside of your building, and they certainly wouldn’t have access to secure areas. A single authentication method would commonly prevent unauthorized access to a data center for both employees and non-employees, although more authentication factors would provide additional security.\n\nB. Spoofing of internal IP addresses when accessing an intranet server Intranet servers are not accessible from the outside. This makes them an unlikely target for hacktivists and other non-employees.\n\nC. Employee VPN access uses a weak encryption cipher A weak encryption cipher can be a security issue, but a potential exploitation would require the network traffic to begin any decryption attempts.

In this example, a daily backup would ensure tax information is constantly archived over a seven year period and could always be retrieved if needed. If data was inadvertently deleted from the primary storage, the backup would still maintain a copy. \n\nThe incorrect answers:\n\nA. Automate a script to remove all tax information more than seven years old The requirement is to maintain data for at least seven years, but there’s no requirement to remove that data after that time frame. For example, some financial information may need to be retained well beyond the seven year mandate.\n\nB.

Organized crime Organized crime can be very effective at hacking systems and companies, but they can only affect systems where they have access.

Install the latest version of JRE on the server The system administrator verified that JRE was not currently installed on the server, so it would not be possible for that vulnerability to actually exist. Installing an unneeded version of JRE on the server could potentially open the server to actual vulnerabilities.\n\nB. Quarantine the server and scan for malware The JRE false positive isn’t an indication of malware, and there's no mention of any additional vulnerabilities or reports of malware.\n\nC. Harden the operating system of the web server Although it’s always a good best practice to harden the operating system of an externally-facing server, this vulnerability scan report doesn’t indicate any particular vulnerability with the operating system itself.

Firewall rules must be built to match the traffic flows, and only then will traffic pass through the firewall. \n\nThe incorrect answers:\n\nA. Create a single firewall rule with an explicit deny By default, most firewalls have an implicit deny as the last policy in the firewall rules. If traffic does not match any other firewall rule, then the implicit deny drops the traffic. Manually configuring an explicit deny doesn’t provide any additional traffic control because of the alreadyexisting implicit deny, and it doesn’t allow any traffic to pass through the firewall because the rule itself denies all traffic.\n\nB.

Hashing Hashing is a one-way cryptographic function which takes an input, such as a password, and creates a fixed size string of random information.

Prevent users from posting passwords near their workstations Organized crime members usually access systems remotely. Although it’s important for users to protect their passwords, the organized crime members aren’t generally in a position to view information on a person's desk.\n\nB.

Remove unauthorized MAC addresses from the filter Since MAC addresses are visible when capturing packets, any unauthorized users affected by the removal of a MAC address would simply view the remaining MAC addresses in use and spoof those addresses to gain access.\n\nC. Modify the SSID name The SSID (Service Set Identifier) is the name associated with the wireless network. The name of the access point is not a security feature, so changing the name would not provide any additional access control.\n\nD.
